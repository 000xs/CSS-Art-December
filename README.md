# December Scene - CSS Art

## Description
This project represents a cozy winter scene inspired by the month of December. The CSS art features a snow-covered cabin, a friendly snowman, and gently falling snowflakes. It captures the warmth and tranquility of winter, evoking the festive and serene atmosphere often associated with the holiday season.

## Approach
The design utilizes pure HTML and CSS to craft the visual elements, with subtle animations to create the effect of snowfall. Key elements include:
- A wooden cabin with a glowing window.
- A three-tier snowman positioned near the cabin.
- Animated snowflakes falling from the top of the screen.

The project uses `clip-path` for the cabin roof, CSS `box-shadow` for added depth, and `keyframes` for animating the snowflakes.

## How to Run
1. Copy the HTML and CSS code into a new `.html` file.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser to view the scene.

## Customization
- You can adjust the snowfall speed by modifying the `animation-duration` in the `fall` keyframe.
- Change the color scheme to fit different holiday aesthetics or regional inspirations.

## Acknowledgements
This CSS art is part of a creative challenge to represent personal reflections of December through digital design.

Enjoy the serene winter atmosphere brought to life through the magic of CSS!
